# Chronic Disease Management System

## Overview
The Chronic Disease Management System is designed to predict diseases based on users' symptoms using a robust machine learning model. This project was developed as part of the SparkTheSummer Hackathon, where our team secured the 2nd prize in the Mindstromsoft's Problems track.

## Features
- Predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
- User-friendly interface for inputting symptoms and viewing predictions.
- Integration of a background removal tool for images.
- Secure and efficient data handling.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chronic-disease-management-system.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
  cd chronic-disease-management-system

3.Install the required packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1.Start the Flask server:
  python app.py
2.Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000.
